# Adaptive-Thresholding
Adaptive thresholding is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions. This leads to different threshold values for different regions with respect to the change in lighting. In this exercise the basic Otsu's algorithm is extended in order to achieve adaptive thresholding on an image.
